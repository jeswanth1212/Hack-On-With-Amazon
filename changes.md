3. As you can see the icons are not placed properly. The time section is too much to the left and is not in proepr alignment at all. What I would suggest is, just remove that section totally, and make it again once more without any errors. And also hwo I want the nav bar to be:
Top Left: Profile Settings
Top Middle: Search, Live TV, Friends, My List
Top Right:  Time

4. Entire website to be controlled by arrow keys similar to how people would be doing in their tv with their remote. By default when the page opens, the key control should be between search and live tv, so yeah when people click left it should go to search, to live tv if right move, or to the recommendations carousel when bottom click.

5. Trailers shown when people hover over the recommendations carousel below the "My Apps" section.
