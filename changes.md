1. In the hero section carousel, if the auto scroll comes to the last element, then it must continue to the first element and turn into a loop.
2. The nav bar still looks improper.
- Add more top bottom dark gradient.
- When I hover over a elemenet, there must be a smooth snimation of the text of the icon and both of them must be in a enclosed container thats slightly highlighted.
3. I want the carousels that are below my apps to be like the image ive added as context.
